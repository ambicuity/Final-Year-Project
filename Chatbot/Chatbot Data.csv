What are Card Present  (CP) and Card Not Present (CNP) transactions?,A CP transaction is a card transaction that is carried out through physical presence of card at the point of transaction. It is also known as face-to-face or a proximity payment transaction. An example is a transaction carried out at an ATM or a PoS terminal. A CNP transaction does not require the card to be physically presented at the point of transaction. It is also called as a remote transaction. An example is an online transaction or a mobile banking transaction using the card.,Card Transactions
Who decides the limits  for cash withdrawal or purchase of goods and services through a card?,"The limits on cash withdrawal at ATMs and for purchase of goods and services are decided by the card issuer.

How are the transactions carried out through cards protected  against fraudulent usage?,"All CP and CNP transactions on cards issued in India are secured with AFA. This AFA can be in any form and few commonly used forms are PIN, dynamic one-time password (OTP), static code, etc. The requirement of AFA is not mandatory for transactions where outflow of foreign exchange is contemplated.

What is Cheque Truncation?,"Truncation is the process of stopping the flow of the physical cheque issued by a drawer at some point by the presenting bank en-route to the paying bank branch. In its place an electronic image of the cheque is transmitted to the paying branch through the clearing house, along with relevant information like data on the MICR band, date of presentation, presenting bank, etc. Cheque truncation thus obviates the need to move the physical instruments across bank branches, other than in exceptional circumstances for clearing purposes. This effectively eliminates the associated cost of movement of the physical cheques, reduces the time required for their collection and brings elegance to the entire activity of cheque processing.",Cheque Truncation System
Why Cheque Truncation in India?,"Cheque Truncation speeds up the process of collection of cheques resulting in better service to customers, reduces the scope of loss of instruments in transit, lowers the cost of collection of cheques, and removes reconciliation-related and logistics-related problems, thus benefitting the system as a whole. 
With the other major products being offered in the form of RTGS and NEFT, the Reserve Bank has created the capability to enable inter-bank and customer payments online and in near-real time. However, cheques continue to be the prominent mode of payments in the country. Reserve Bank of India has therefore decided to focus on improving the efficiency of the cheque clearing cycle. Offering Cheque Truncation System (CTS) is a step in this direction. 
In addition to operational efficiency, CTS offers several benefits to banks and customers, including human resource rationalisation, cost effectiveness, business process re-engineering, better service, adoption of latest technology, etc. CTS, thus, has emerged as an important efficiency enhancement initiative undertaken by Reserve Bank in the Payments Systems arena.",Cheque Truncation System
What is the status of CTS  implementation in the country?,"CTS has been implemented in New Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai with effect from February 1, 2008, September 24, 2011 and April 27, 2013 respectively. After migration of the entire cheque volume from MICR system to CTS, the traditional MICR-based cheque processing has been discontinued across the country.",Cheque Truncation System
What are the benefits of Grid Based  CTS over Speed Clearing to the customer?,"Even though Speed clearing hastens the process of cheque collection as compared to outstation cheque collection, it requires the presence of the paying bank branch in the clearing house location. In comparison, grid-based CTS, is a superior system as it encompasses a larger geographical area and the chances of paying bank not having presence in the grid location is seldom. 
Under grid-based Cheque Truncation System clearing, all cheques drawn on bank branches falling within in the grid jurisdiction are treated and cleared as local cheques. Cheque collection charges including Speed Clearing Charges should not be levied if the collecting bank and the paying bank are located within the jurisdiction of the same CTS grid even though they are located in different cities.",Cheque Truncation System
Is it possible to briefly explain  the entire process flow in CTS?,"In CTS, the presenting bank (or its branch) captures the data (on the MICR band) and the images of a cheque using their Capture System (comprising of a scanner, core banking or other application) which is internal to them, and have to meet the specifications and standards prescribed for data and images. 
To ensure security, safety and non-repudiation of data / images, end-to-end Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) has been implemented in CTS. As part of the requirement, the collecting bank (presenting bank) sends the data and captured images duly signed digitally and encrypted to the central processing location (Clearing House) for onward transmission to the paying bank (destination or drawee bank). For the purpose of participation the presenting and paying banks are provided with an interface / gateway called the Clearing House Interface (CHI) that enables them to connect and transmit data and images in a secure and safe manner to the Clearing House (CH). 
The Clearing House processes the data, arrives at the settlement figure and routes the images and requisite data to the paying banks. This is called the presentation clearing. The paying banks through their CHIs receive the images and data from the Clearing House for payment processing. 
The paying bankís CHIs also generates the return file for unpaid instruments, if any. The return file / data sent by the paying banks are processed by the Clearing House in the return clearing session in the same way as presentation clearing and return data is provided to the presenting banks for processing. 
The clearing cycle is treated as complete once the presentation clearing and the associated return clearing sessions are successfully processed. The entire essence of CTS technology lies in the use of images of cheques (instead of the physical cheques) for payment processing.",Cheque Truncation System
What type of instruments  can be presented for clearing through CTS?,"Only CTS 2010 compliant instruments can be presented for clearing through CTS. The separate non-CTS clearing sessions in CTS grid centres was discontinued with effect from December 31, 2018.",Cheque Truncation System
Will there be any change in the  process for the customers?,"No. There is no major change in the clearing process for customers. Customers continue to use cheques as at present, except to ensure the use of image-friendly-coloured-inks while writing the cheques. Of course, such of those customers, who are used to receiving the paid instruments (like government departments) would also receive the cheque images. Cheques with alterations in material fields (explained in detail later) are not allowed to be processed under the CTS environment.",Cheque Truncation System
What are the benefits of CTS to  customers of banks?,"Benefits of CTS to customer of banks:

Shorter clearing cycle. 
Superior verification and reconciliation process. 
No geographical restrictions as to jurisdiction. 
Operational efficiency for banks and customers alike. 
Reduction in operational risk and risks associated with paper clearing. 
No collection charges for collection of cheque drawn on a bank located within the grid.",Cheque Truncation System
What are the benefits of Grid Based CTS to the banking system?,"Grid based CTS provides significant cost savings. Consolidation of clearing locations into a few grids minimise the investment in MICR machines and the related AMC costs. Banks will benefit from economies of scale as the grid CTS obviates the need for establishing inward cheque processing infrastructure at various clearing locations. With the merger of many local clearing houses with CTS grids, the settlements which were earlier spread across numerous clearing house locations have been subsumed into a single settlement, thereby significantly reducing the liquidity requirements for the banks. 
CTS will also result in other benefits in terms of reduction in the cheque processing fee, reduction in operational overhead, elimination of clearing differences and reconciliation issues etc.",Cheque Truncation System
"If a customer desires to see the physical cheque issued by  him for any reason, what are the options available?","Under CTS the physical cheques are retained at the presenting bank and do not move to the paying banks. In case a customer desires, banks can provide images of cheques duly certified/authenticated. In case, however, a customer desires to see / get the physical cheque, it would need to be sourced from the presenting bank, for which a request has to be made to his/her bank. An element of cost / charge may also be involved for the purpose. To meet legal requirements, the presenting banks which truncate the cheques need to preserve the physical instruments for a period of 10 years.",Cheque Truncation System
How would be the uniqueness of a physical cheque be captured  and imparted to the cheque image?,"CTS in India mandates the use of prescribed image specifications only. Images that do not meet the specifications are rejected. As the payments are made on the basis of the images, it is essential to ensure the quality of the images. To ensure only images of requisite quality move in the CTS processing cycle, there is a rigorous quality check process at the level of the Capture Systems and the Clearing House Interface (of the presenting bank). 
The solution encompasses Image Quality Assessment (IQA) at different levels. The presenting bank is required to perform the IQA during the capture itself. Further IQA is done at the gateway before onward transmission to clearing house. The images are captured with digital signatures of the presenting bank and thereafter transmitted to the paying banks through the Clearing House. Further, the paying banks, if not satisfied with the image quality or for any other reason, can demand for the physical instrument before making payment of the instrument. 
Further, the new cheque standard ""CTS-2010"" prescribes certain mandatory and optional security features to be available on cheques, which will also add to the uniqueness of the images.",Cheque Truncation System
What are the image specifications in CTS in the Indian  context?,"Imaging of cheques can be based on various technology options. The cheque images can be Black & White, Gray Scale or Coloured. These have their associated advantages and disadvantages. Black & White images are light in terms of image-size, but do not reveal all the subtle features that are there in the cheques. Coloured images are ideal but increase storage and network bandwidth requirements. Gray Scale images are mid-way. CTS in India use a combination of Gray Scale and Black & White images. There are three images of each cheques that need to be taken - front Gray Scale, front Black & White and back Black & White.",Cheque Truncation System
How are the images of cheques taken?,"Images of cheques are taken using specific scanners. Scanners also function like photo-copiers by reflecting the light passed through a narrow passage on to the document. Tiny sensors measure the reflection from each point along the strip of light. Reflectance measurements of each dot are called a pixel. Images are classified as black and white, gray-scale or colour based on how the pixels are converted into digital values. For getting a gray scale image the pixels are mapped onto a range of gray shades between black and white. The entire image of the original document gets mapped as some shade of gray, lighter or darker, depending on the colour of the source. In the case of black and white images, such mapping is made only to two colours based on the range of values of contrasts. A black and white image is also called a binary image.",Cheque Truncation System
How the image and data transmitted over the network is  secured?,"The security, integrity, non-repudiation and authenticity of the data and image transmitted from the presenting bank to the paying bank through Clearing House are ensured using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). CTS is compliant to the requirements of the IT Act, 2000. It has been made mandatory for the presenting bank to sign the images and data from the point of origin itself. PKI is used throughout the entire cycle covering capture system, the presenting bank, the clearing house and the paying bank. The PKI standards used are in accordance with the appropriate Indian acts and notifications of Controller of Certifying Authority (CCA).",Cheque Truncation System
What is Cheque Standardisation and what does CTS 2010 Standard mean?,"Standardisation of cheque forms (leaves) in terms of size, MICR band, quality of paper, etc., was one of the key factors that enabled mechanisation of cheque processing. Over a period of time, banks have added a variety of patterns and design of cheque forms to aid segmentation, branding, identification, etc., as also incorporated therein a number of security features to reduce the incidence of cheque misuse, tampering, alterations, etc. Growing use of multi-city and payable-at-par cheques for handling of cheques at any branches of a bank, introduction of Cheque Truncation System (CTS), increasing popularity of Speed Clearing, etc., were a few aspects that led to prescription of certain common minimum security features in cheques printed, issued and handled by banks and customers uniformly across the banking industry. 
Accordingly, certain benchmarks towards achieving standardisation of cheques issued by banks across the country have been prescribed like ñ quality of paper, watermark, bankís logo in invisible ink, void pantograph, etc., and standardisation of field placements on cheques. In addition, certain desirable features have also been suggested to be implemented by banks based on their need and risk perception. 
The set of minimum security features would not only ensure uniformity across all cheque forms issued by banks in the country but also help presenting banks while scrutinising / recognising cheques of paying banks in an image-based processing scenario. The homogeneity in security features is expected to act as a deterrent against cheque frauds, while the standardisation of field placements on cheque forms would enable straight-through-processing by use of optical / image character recognition technology. The benchmark prescriptions are collectively known as ""CTS-2010 standard"". 
All banks providing cheque facility to their customers have been advised to issue only 'CTS-2010' standard cheques. Cheques not complying with CTS-2010 standards will not be cleared through CTS clearing (updated as on June 30, 2020).",Cheque Truncation System
What is the prescription relating to alterations /  corrections on cheque forms?,"The prescription on prohibiting alterations / corrections on cheques has been introduced to curtail cheque related frauds. No changes / corrections can be carried out on the cheques (other than for date validation purposes, if required). For any change in the payeeís name, courtesy amount (amount in figures) or legal amount (amount in words), fresh cheque leaves should be used by customers. This would help banks in identifying and controlling fraudulent alterations. This prohibition is applicable to cheques cleared under the image based Cheque Truncation System (CTS) only. It is not applicable to cheques cleared under physical exchange of instruments.",Cheque Truncation System
What are the precautions required to be taken by the banks /  customers to avoid frauds?,"Banks / Customers should use ""CTS 2010"" cheques which are not only image friendly but also have more security features. Customers may request/insist their banks for cheque forms that are compliant with the ""CTS 2010"" standard. They should preferably use image-friendly coloured inks while writing cheques and avoid any alterations / corrections thereon. Preferably, a new cheque leaf may be used in the event of any alterations / corrections as the cheque may be cleared through image based clearing system. 
Banks should exercise care while affixing stamps on the cheque forms, so that it does not interfere with the material portions such as date, payeeís name, amount and signature.

What is the time taken for effecting funds transfer from  one account to another through RTGS?,"Under normal circumstances, the beneficiary branches are expected to receive the funds in real time as soon as funds are transferred by the remitting bank. The beneficiary bank must credit the beneficiary's account within 30 minutes of receiving the funds transfer message.",RTGS
Can a remitting customer initiate a transaction for a  future date?,"No, the RTGS system does not accept future value dated transactions.",RTGS
Can a transaction be originated to draw (receive) funds  from another account?,"No. RTGS is a credit-push system i.e., transactions can be originated by the payer / remitter / sender only to pay / transfer / remit funds to a beneficiary.",RTGS
Can an RTGS transaction be tracked? Would the remitting  customer receive an acknowledgement of money credited to the beneficiary's  account?,"While the customers do not have the facility to track the transaction, the RBI has implemented the feature of positive confirmation in an RTGS transaction. Under this, the remitting bank would receive a message from RBI (through the beneficiary bank) that the money has been credited to the beneficiary bank / customer account. Based on this, the remitting bank should advise the remitting customer that money has been credited to the receiving bankís beneficiary account.",RTGS
Would the remitting customer get back the money if it is  not credited to the beneficiary's account? Is there any time frame prescribed  for it?,"Yes, if it is not possible to credit the funds to the beneficiary customerís account for any reason, the funds received by the RTGS member bank will be returned to the originating bank within one hour of receipt of the payment at the Payment Interface (PI) or before the end of the RTGS Business day, whichever is earlier. Once the money is received back by the remitting bank, the original debit entry in the customer's account needs to be reversed.",RTGS
Is a customer eligible to get compensation for delay in  returning the payment?,"In case of any delay  in returning the failed payment, the originating customer is eligible to  receive compensation at current repo rate plus 2%.",RTGS
"Whom can a customer contact, in case of non-credit or  delay in credit to the beneficiary account?","The customer can contact his / her bank / branch if there is an issue of delay / non-credit to the beneficiary account. If the issue is not resolved satisfactorily, complaint may be lodged at email or by post at following address giving UTR number and details of the issue- 
The Chief General Manager Customer Education and Protection Department 
1st Floor, Amar Building 
Reserve Bank of India, 
SBS Road, Fort 
Mumbai ñ 400 001",RTGS
What is UTR number?,Unique Transaction Reference (UTR) number is a 22 character code used to uniquely identify a transaction in RTGS system.,RTGS
What  is LEI and what is its purpose?,"The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-digit number used to uniquely identify parties to financial transactions worldwide. It has been implemented to improve the quality and accuracy of financial data reporting systems for better risk management. It is used to create a global reference data system that uniquely identifies every legal entity in any jurisdiction that is party to a financial transaction. It can be obtained from any of the Local Operating Units (LOUs) accredited by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the body tasked to support the implementation and use of LEI. In India, LEI can be obtained from Legal Entity Identifier India Ltd. (LEIL) (https://www.ccilindia-lei.co.in), which is also recognised as an issuer of LEI by the Reserve Bank.",RTGS
Which RTGS transactions should include LEI information?,"All payment transactions of value ?50 crore and above undertaken by entities (non-individuals) should include remitter and beneficiary LEI information from April 1, 2021. Banks should use the ëRemittance Informationí field for recording Remitter and Beneficiary LEI.",RTGS
Is LEI required for individual customer transactions?,"No, LEI is not required for customer transactions where both remitter and beneficiary are individuals.",RTGS
 Hi!, What is your favorite holiday?,Conversation
 one where I get to meet lots of different people., What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?,Conversation
Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25., Which holiday was that?,Conversation
 I think it was Australia, Do you still talk to the people you met?,Conversation
 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them," Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?",Conversation
 what do you mean?," I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as ""cold readings"" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again.",Conversation
" Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky"," There's this practice called ""Treasure Hunting"" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called ""The Ultimate Treasure Hunt"" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.",Conversation
" So, do you do treasure hunting often?"," I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific.",Conversation
 Hi, Any plans for the weekend?,Conversation
 my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!, That's great! How's the weather over the weekend? I hope its warm.,Conversation
 Should be very sunny! you?, Cool! very depressing plans ... stay home and work 😞 I have a project deadline very close.,Conversation
 😐 hope you get your work done very soon! a bug free weekend!," Right, very anxious! where do you plan to go for a hike?",Conversation
 I am going to Diablo!," Nice, where is that place? I haven't been there",Conversation
 hours drive from here. still in bay area, That's cool! How long is the hike?,Conversation
"  Actually no idea, but it will take the entire day for that.", nice! sounds fun!,Conversation
 Hi!, Hey there! What's up???,Conversation
" Nothing much, how you doin?", I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D,Conversation
 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?," The last time in New York, back in June.",Conversation
 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...," Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently",Conversation
 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?, Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?,Conversation
" Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!", What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?,Conversation
 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?, I'd love to try! Can we schedule something for next week?,Conversation
 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?," Saturday looks pretty good, shall we shoot for something in the morning?",Conversation
 Hi!, hey,Conversation
 is it raining pretty bad today?," yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options",Conversation
 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy," yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here 😛",Conversation
" Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too..."," yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down",Conversation
 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms, yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here,Conversation
 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area," it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire",Conversation
 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?," nope, what does it say?",Conversation
 Hi., Helloooooo!,Conversation
 How are you? How is your day?," Good. Don't have much to do today, feels good. How are you?",Conversation
 I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook., So what's your outlook? Something blue?,Conversation
 Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?," You should drink more water, do some push up, and sleep early.",Conversation
 Hi!," Hey, how are you?",Conversation
 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat., Oh no… Have you sent out the missing cat posters? Hope your cat is alright!,Conversation
" Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?"," Yea, I know they love the plastic bag sound all the time. I am good, nothing special though.",Conversation
" If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?"," I like rainforest, but I know it requires extensive training beforehand.",Conversation
 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree., I am afraid I will be scared of doing this :),Conversation
" I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.", I don't know if there is any medication for acrophobia. I want to take plenty of it if I really have to do it.,Conversation
" If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions", That's a great idea! Maybe alcohol is such a thing.,Conversation
" Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!", Oops. I won't do it again. Ha,Conversation
 Hi!, Hey sup,Conversation
 not much. any plans this weekend?, I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?,Conversation
 ziplining?, that's the one! have you ever tried it?,Conversation
 i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience, where did you do it?,Conversation
" i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though", no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?,Conversation
 that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you, sure. are you just going home now?,Conversation
" no, i'm going to get a massage first", nice. what type?,Conversation
 traditional kind, yeah I want to get one too soon,Conversation
 you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!, ttyl!,Conversation
 Hi!," Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?",Conversation
" I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?"," I have never seen Avatar, what is it about? I really enjoy the Avenger movies",Conversation
" it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature", That sounds really cool! I think that movie did really well when it was in the box office so it must be good!,Conversation
 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?, I enjoy baking cookies. I am on a quest to bake the best chocolate chip cookie 🙂 What about you?,Conversation
 I enjoy eating 🙂, so definitely would like to try your best chocolate cookie,Conversation
 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?, thanks! I generally love noodle soups like Pho or Ramen :),Conversation
 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?, I prefer to go out. I'm not a good cook haha,Conversation
" Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook"," seems like we share a thing in common, yay!",Conversation
 How has your week been?, So far so good. It is holiday season. So just chilling,Conversation
 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December., lol Sorry to hear that. Are you planning anything fun for December?,Conversation
 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick., 😂,Conversation
 Do you have big plans?, Yes! I am going to Hawaii! This will be my first time visiting Hawaii. Really excited about it.,Conversation
 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion., lol this is the first time I heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion. I cannot agree more.,Conversation
 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day., 😂,Conversation
" Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?", Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?,Conversation
 Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax., Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.,Conversation
" Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!"," I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?",Conversation
 Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome.., Are you doing any home decorating then?,Conversation
 Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.," I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.",Conversation
" Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year."," I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?",Conversation
" Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.", I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?,Conversation
" Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.", Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot. She even made a Target credit card because she comes to that store very often. Okay thanks for the suggestion. I'll check out Target.,Conversation
 Hi!, Hey,Conversation
 How's your day going?, pretty good. yours?,Conversation
" Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..", oh what happened?,Conversation
 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :'), hahah wait for real?,Conversation
 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?, No I'm not in school anymore,Conversation
 Oh I see. What do you do?, I train and compete in horse vaulting,Conversation
" Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?", lol you're too funny,Conversation
 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?," Yeah, but I part time work on a farm. Helping with a bit of everything",Conversation
" Wow, sounds very busy! Do you with money at those horse vaulting competitions?", Yeah some. enough to get by,Conversation
 Hi!, Hello,Conversation
 Do you have a favourite flower?," hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?",Conversation
 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?, Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?,Conversation
" Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.", Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?,Conversation
" The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew ""flower"" with a crayon and then it came to life."," Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.",Conversation
" Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?", yes,Conversation
" Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila"," Hehe, i think you should publish this someday :)",Conversation
" Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!", Hey how's it going,Conversation
 It's good it's good. How are you?, good. it's really hot today. I think I'm going to the pool,Conversation
 Oh nice! Where do you live?," I live in Mukesh Patel, NMIMS",Conversation
" Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....", oh have you been?,Conversation
 Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!, what did you do here?,Conversation
" Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha", lol why did you come to Japan just to go to Disney land?,Conversation
" The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!", oh neat. I haven't heard about that robot fighting show. where is that??,Conversation
" I don't really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I'm sure you can find it if you google ""giant robot fighting show Mukesh Patel"" haha", lol ok,Conversation
 Hi!, Have you seen any good movies lately?,Conversation
" Last weekend I saw ""The Parasite."" Ever heard of it?", No. Why did you pick that movie?,Conversation
 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?, I played music and worked on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.,Conversation
 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!," Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol",Conversation
 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?," I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?",Conversation
 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha, Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.,Conversation
" Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha", Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome 😀,Conversation
 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before," He's the adopted brother of Thor, God of thunder, and is burdened with glorious purpose. Do you feel that burden?",Conversation
 Hi!," Hey, what's up?",Conversation
 Just chillin'. how are you?," I'm pretty good, thanks.",Conversation
 Do anything interesting today?, I went to the local cafe and had a double espresso. It was delicious. What about you?,Conversation
 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!, Oh my gosh. What was it like??,Conversation
" It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?"," No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.",Conversation
" Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?"," No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.",Conversation
 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha," Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?",Conversation
" Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?", I think I sort of understand :),Conversation
 Hi!," hello there, how is it going?",Conversation
 All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?, I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.,Conversation
 oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation," yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?",Conversation
" I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.", staying at home is always nice during the holidays,Conversation
 Where are you based out of these days?," I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?",Conversation
 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks," aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!",Conversation
 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point., that's really sad. are they feeling any better?,Conversation
" Yes, everyone recovered now", Hello,Conversation
 How's it going?, Extremely busy. I have been trying to prepare for the upcoming holidays. How about you?,Conversation
 I'm going to the bahamas. Can't wait!!!," I'm jealous, take me with you!! I would love to have some warm weather right now",Conversation
 oh where are you now?, Canada. There is another major snowstorm that might hit this weekend so I have been rushing to get everything done before it comes.,Conversation
 oh no. I never seen this in person. Is it scary?, Snow is not scary as long as you're prepared. You just need to be ready to not have electricity for a while. I enjoy the aftermath of a good snowstorm because then you can go sledding or skiing.,Conversation
 that does sound nice. so what are you doing these holidays?, I am having all of the extended family over for a big meal. We will also go <REDACTED_TERM> as well. What will you do in the bahamas?,Conversation
 nice nice. I'm gonna go snorkeling yey, Sounds fun! I wish I knew how to swim!,Conversation
 You can stay on the shallow side I think. Well hope you enjoy time with your extended family!," That's true. You too, have a great time snorkeling!",Conversation
 Hi!, Hi! How was your weekend?,Conversation
 pretty good. just went to church and hangout with friends, Nice,Conversation
 did you do anything?, I made donuts and samosas with an air fryer have you used one of those before,Conversation
 yum yum yum no only good old oily frier, haha,Conversation
 do you have one at your home or were you at a friends place?, I was at my parents' place what are you up to for Thanksgiving?,Conversation
 I'm going to impersonate a pumpkin," wow, those are unique plans",Conversation
 I'm pretty unique person, I think so too,Conversation
 any other hobbies besides air frying everything? 🙂, I want to start fermenting things kimchi for example sounds like a fun thing to ferment takes a few days apparently miso takes a couple years to fermen,Conversation
 Hi!," heya, nice to meet you!",Conversation
 nice to meet you too! I'm James. how are you doing today?, I'm doing OK. Looking forwards to the weekend. how about you?,Conversation
 same here! I hope the weather will be nice," oh yeah, but I don't have my hopes too high, I heard there could be a storm coming our way",Conversation
" oh no, which areas will be affected?", they mentioned that the whole city will experience harsh weather and that people in the outskirts will probably not get much rain and wind,Conversation
" uh oh, I'd better not to plan for BBQ then instead just enjoying playing board games inside 🙂"," yeah, it'll be good weather for staying inside with a cup of hot chocolate. Too bad my street usually floods, so I'll have to check for that",Conversation
" yea, you'd better check. where do you live?"," I live at the bottom of the valley, cheap area but we do get affected by this kind of stuff a lot haha",Conversation
 gotcha. anything you love about where you live?," well, the food around the area is amazing, which is definitely a plus.",Conversation
 Hi!," hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂",Conversation
 I am the superman! What about you?," haha. great chating with superman, what is your power?",Conversation
 Being invisible. You won't see me., haha. what else can you do? can you read minds?,Conversation
 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!, wow that seems pretty technical. what does fMRI mean?,Conversation
 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution., okay! so you seem to like science a lot?,Conversation
 I believe in Science! Science is my god!, Are you also doing science?,Conversation
" no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?", People are always arguing. Probably both science and democracy are both important I guess.,Conversation
 Does it make sense?, I think so. thanks for your point!,Conversation
" Hello, Nice to meet you"," If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?",Conversation
